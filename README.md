# BC_C4_JSQuiz
A quiz built using JavaScript

## Description

This project was created to get a better understanding on the inner workings of JavaScript, and to learn how it can control the different elements within a webpage.

- The project was an aid to help us understand loops, functions, storing JSON in the browswer, retrieving JSON from the browswer, and manipulating elements within the HTML
- For this particular project I created two HTML pages, and two JS documents. From here I was able to see how the corresponding script pages worked for each individual html page
- I was able to both HTML pages to work off a single CSS page by creating unique IDs and classes called on the CSS
- As this was the first project where I had multiple pages, I was able to learn how to create a file structure to upload to GITHub and how to call the different pages inside 
  the HTML when working in this structure.
